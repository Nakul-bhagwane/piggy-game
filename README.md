Hello everyone Nakul here
this is simple javascript game i got the idea to make this from the famouse t-rax game of the google chrome 

this is very easy to understand
there are three section or we can say windows in the game first is starting window and then main game and then game over 
window/section 



=> this game is not responsive but works good in the desktop or laptop
